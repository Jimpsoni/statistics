# statistics
A small "Project" to help me understand more of the statistics and python unit testing by building a hands on project.   (Build solely for personal use. Don't except too much!)

In "Statistics" class, there is methods to calculate features of data. It is built based on this statistics course made by Geek's Lessons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbbYntt5CJk&t=10869s&ab_channel=Geek%27sLesson  
I will continue updating this repo as I go through his course!
